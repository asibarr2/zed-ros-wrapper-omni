# zed-ros-wrapper-omni
This is the zed ros package configured for the omni bot. If you launch the original package, the urdf config in this package will interfere with your own urdf model. I have deleted some parameters that will enable you to have an easier time using this package.


1. Rename this package to "zed_wrapper" once it is installed in ~/catkin_ws/src 

2. Build the package using catkin_make in ~/catkin_make
